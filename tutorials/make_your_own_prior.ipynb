    "Priors take the form of classes that inherit from `prior.Prior`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class UniformMchirpQPrior(prior.Prior):\n",
    "\n",
    "A prior class can use any coordinate system for sampling but should also provide a transformation to \"standard\" coordinates (`.standard_params`). In this way, likelihood objects can later be used in combination with priors without a need to redefine them every time we want to change coordinate system.\n",
    "The convention for which are the \"standard\" parameters in `coghweel` is defined in `waveform.WaveformGenerator.params`. Namely:\n",
    "`d_luminosity, dec, f_ref, iota, l1, l2, m1, m2, phi_ref, psi, ra, s1x_n, s1y_n, s1z, s2x_n, s2y_n, s2z, t_geocenter` (or a subset of them, in the case of marginalized likelihoods).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present example, the relevant standard parameters that our prior should take care of are the detector frame masses `m1, m2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "        standard_params = ['m1', 'm2']\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will use a more convenient coordinate system to parameterize these variables, namely, chirp mass and mass ratio (\"sampled parameters\").\n",
    "To implement this, we define an attribute `range_dic` with the sampled parameter names and their ranges. In this case, the range is not known in advance, since different events may require different ranges in order to sample efficiently around the region of posterior support. Thus, we leave it as `None`:\n",
    "\n",
    "        range_dic = {'mchirp': None,\n",
    "                     'q': None}\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range_dic` will have to be overwritten with the actual ranges when instantiating the class (a new instance of the class is created every time we analyze an event). We'll do this in the `__init__`, see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note:* if the range had been known in advance, say $\\psi \\in (0, \\pi)$, we would have done `range_dic = {'psi': (0, np.pi)}` instead, and `range_dic` would have remained a class attribute (shared by all instances).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have defined the standard and sampled parameters, we should define methods `.transform` and `.inverse_transform` to go between them. To avoid confusion when combining priors, these must return dictionaries where the keys are parameter names:\n",
    "\n",
    "        def transform(self, mchirp, q):\n",
    "            \"\"\"Sampled params to standard params.\"\"\"\n",

    "                    'q': m2 / m1}\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we define a method `lnprior` that takes sampled parameters and returns the prior density in that space. In this example, we take the density uniform in $\\mathcal{M}, q$ provided that $m_2$ exceeds some value $m_2^{\\rm min}$:\n",
    "\n",

    "            return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note:* Even if the prior did not depend on all sampled parameters, the method `lnprior` must have them in the signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let us implement the sampled parameter ranges and the cutoff `m2_min`. Since in this case these vary event by event, they will need to be passed when instantiating the class, so we must override the `__init__` method. \n",

    "\n",
    "* The `__init__` method of `Prior` subclasses must accept `**kwargs`, this allows to easily combine them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is important that we have overriden the `range_dic` attribute. Note that we did\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "        self.range_dic = {'mchirp': mchirp_range,\n",

    "        self.range_dic['q'] = (q_min, 1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    In the latter case, `range_dic` would have remained a class attribute, and if we constructed multiple instances simultaneously, e.g. corresponding to different events, they would wrongly have shared the `range_dic` attribute. By overriding `range_dic`, it becomes an instance attribute as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Prior` subclasses must call `super().__init__` forwarding all arguments by keyword. This facilitates multiple inheritance. It is important that `super().__init__` is called after setting `range_dic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whenever we override `Prior.__init__`, we must also override the method `.get_init_dict`, that returns a dictionary with keyword arguments to reproduce the class instance:\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Advanced usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditioned-on parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `UniformMchirpQPrior` example was of the form $p(\\mathcal{M}, q)$, not conditioned on any other parameters. If either the prior or the transformation to standard parameters is conditioned on other parameters, you can do this by defining a `.conditioned_on` attribute, which must be a list of standard parameters (it is an empty list by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take a look at the code for `cogwheel.gw_prior.spin.UniformEffectiveSpinPrior`. It is conditioned on `m1, m2`, since the transform from sampled parameters `chieff, cumchidiff` to standard parameters `s1z, s2z` depends on `m1, m2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the signature of the `lnprior`, `transform` and `inverse_transform` methods should be modified by adding the conditioned-on parameters at the end. Note that the signature of `lnprior` and `transform` is always of the form `(*sampled_params, *conditioned_on)`, and that of `inverse_transform` is of the form `(*standard_params, *conditioned_on)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CombinedPrior` class can handle this case as long as all subpriors in `prior_classes` are only conditioned on standard parameters already covered by the preceding subpriors (as in an autoregressive flow).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common use cases are implemented for convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixing a parameter\n",
    "Use `prior.FixedPrior` if you would like to fix a standard parameter rather than sample it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: subclass `prior.FixedPrior` instead of `prior.Prior`, and define an attribute `standard_par_dic`. This will automatically generate `standard_params`, `range_dic`, `lnprior`, `transform` and `inverse_transform`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See e.g. the code for `gw_prior.miscellaneous.ZeroTidalDeformabilityPrior` or `gw_prior.miscellaneous.FixedReferenceFrequencyPrior` for examples in which you know or don't know the value of the fixed parameters in advance, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniform prior\n",
    "Use `prior.UniformPriorMixin` if your prior has uniform density in the space of sampled parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: subclass `prior.UniformPriorMixin` and `prior.Prior` and define `standard_params`, `range_dic`, `transform` and `inverse_transform`. This will automatically generate `lnprior`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See e.g. `gw_prior.extrinsic.IsotropicInclinationPrior` for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identity transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `prior.IdentityTransformMixin` if a sampled parameter is also a standard parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: subclass `prior.IdentityTransformMixin` and `prior.Prior` and define `range_dic` and `lnprior`. This will automatically generate `standard_params`, `transform` and `inverse_transform`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`IdentityTransformMixin` can be used together with `UniformPriorMixin`, see `gw_prior.extrinsic.UniformPolarizationPrior` for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folded parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know in advance that a sampled parameter may exhibit an approximate discrete symmetry, you can ease the sampling by [folding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.03508.pdf#section*.15) the distribution along that parameter(s).\n",
