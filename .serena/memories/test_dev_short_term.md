# Test Dev Short-Term Observations

## 2026-07-20 build8c test_lensing_surrogate (TEST 11/12/13)
- TEST 11 (preservation): 8a suite greened vs landed multi-chart surrogate.
  Root cause of 7 reds = `_refusal_surrogate()` box (0.8,1.2) centres on
  gamma=1.0, and `from_engine` calls UNWRAPPED `_box_region_labels` at box
  centre -> LensDomainError. Fix: box->(0.8,1.3), n_gamma=6 preserves 0.1
  spacing + the gamma=1 refusal column, nudges centre to valid 1.05. No
  tolerance weakened. Only 2 real single-box scrapes needed re-target:
  `_param_spacing`->`charts[0].param_spacing`; F010 mutation now patches
  `surrogate_module._in_exclusion_ball` (the load-bearing guard both
  `envelope`+`in_domain` share via `_farfield_raw_chart`), not `in_domain`.
  Property shims (gamma_grid etc.->charts[0]) already cover the rest.
- TEST 12/13 added: `_multichart_fixture()` (lru_cached) builds a 4-chart
  surrogate (pos_tube/pos_ff/sad_tube/sad_ff) from synthetic smooth tensors
  via TubeChart/FarFieldChart.from_values — NO engine calls, runs instant.
  Overlap band engineered via ff eta_overlap_min=0.02 < tube eta_max=0.05
  (eta in (0.02,0.05] double-matches -> tube priority wins). Negative-theta
  saddle wedge theta_grid=[-0.39,-0.09] exercises `_theta_into_frame` unwrap
  (query theta=2pi-0.19 -> -0.19). Provenance MUST use lists not tuples
  (json round-trip value-equality). refused_points always (n,3) via
  `_normalize_refused` (None->empty(0,3)) so npz allow_pickle=False safe.
  Self-falsification: dataclasses.replace(tube, eta_max=0.025) flips overlap
  selection tube->ff. No-double-serve proved by isolating each chart in a
  1-chart surrogate. Full suite: 33 passed, 1 skipped (timing opt-in), ~5min.
